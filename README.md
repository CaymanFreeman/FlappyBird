## Play

You can play the game [here](https://CaymanFreeman.github.io/FlappyBird). It may take a few seconds to download the
binary and the page will appear blank while this is happening.

## Overview

This project is a clone of the original game and is based the core movement mechanics from a video
by [Biped Potato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C28kqin94c). It uses the Bevy ECS (Entity-Component-System) game
engine. Thanks to Bevy and Rust's cross-platform compatibility, the game can be compiled
for almost any platform, including WebAssembly (WASM), allowing it to be played directly in your browser. A WASM version
of the game is hosted on this repository's [gh-pages](https://github.com/CaymanFreeman/FlappyBird/tree/gh-pages) branch.
